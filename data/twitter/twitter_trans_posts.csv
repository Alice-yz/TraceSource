twitter,1385599760476819456,Japan's discharge of nuclear wastewater into the sea is not a political issue， but a matter of life and health. It is a marine environmental issue， so South Korea should not take a political stance. If nuclear wastewater meets standards and can still be consumed， as Japan has said， then Japan will not seal and treat nuclear wastewater. The United States will not ban the import of Japanese contaminated food. From the current technology， even if nuclear wastewater is treated， it cannot completely remove radioactive substances from it,日本核废水排海不是政治问题是生命健康的问题是海洋环境问题所以韩国不应该政治站队如果如日方所说核污水达标还能饮用那么日方也不会将核废水密封处理美方也不会禁止进口日本相关受到核污染的食品从当前的技术来看即使核废水进行相关处理也不能完全去除其中的放射性物质,2021-04-23 22:21:40,8.0,30.0,4.0,1.297457829658284e+18,mofazhuzhu,魔法珠珠🇨🇳,https://twitter.com/mofazhuzhu/status/1385599760476819456,post,https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1599803632072785924/T1y6RTU7_normal.jpg,,background,,,
twitter,1387311770839130112,It's because there were problems with the treatment by TEPCO， and in the end， it could only be discharged into the sea. This is what harms the nuclear power industry. Do you understand that talking about the harm without considering the dosage is all about playing hooliganism? Now， the continuous generation of nuclear wastewater is TEPCO's problem. Since you have made mistakes， you must adopt strict responsibility principles. Of course， after treatment， it is not possible to discharge it into the sea. Filtering will produce solid radioactive waste. You need to first handle the solid radioactive waste and explain it to the international community,就是因为东电处理的有问题到了最后只能排海这才是伤害核电行业明白吗脱离剂量谈危害都是耍流氓现在造成核污水不断产生是东电的问题你既然有过错就要采取严格责任原则当然处理过后不是就完全不可以排海你过滤是会产生固体放射性废物的你得先把固体放射性废物处理先跟国际社会讲明白,2021-04-24 15:44:35,0.0,3.0,0.0,559333130.0,Serenity1944,JP-6,https://twitter.com/Serenity1944/status/1387311770839130112,post,https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1660695885209276416/AKR0SaU0_normal.jpg,,background,,,
twitter,1385599763861680130,The Japanese side has not exhausted all methods to treat nuclear wastewater and insists on discharging it into the sea purely to save money.

First， Japan's people and major powers support it because it is much better to discharge nuclear wastewater into the sea than to put it on land as a huge source of harm. Second， you can see the more neutral DWCOM. German media reports say that there are many other radioactive elements with greater harm. Japan confuses the public and only emphasizes tritium,快一年了第一次对李老师观点失望李老师的观点明显非常不中立 第一日本的国人大国赞成那是因为把核废水排入大海比放在陆地成为一个巨大危害源要好好多好多 第二可以看看比较中立的dw com德国媒体的报道里面说了有很多其他危害更大的放射性元素日本混淆视听只强调氚,2023-08-25 09:45:50,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.5923004496167854e+18,tomlock25694842,tom lock,https://twitter.com/tomlock25694842/status/1694888786327748790,post,https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1592300611898585091/GEI8qvk8_normal.png,,background,0.0,240_china_nuclear_pollution,

The concept of cooling water that has passed through the core of a nuclear reactor and cooling water that has not passed through the core are different. The former is called primary cooling water， while the latter is called secondary cooling water. Although it has not passed through the core， secondary cooling water also contains trace amounts of radioactivity. The main radioactive element is tritium， which can be directly discharged into the sea as long as it meets the safety standards of the International Atomic Energy Agency,日本排放的不是核废水而是核污水概念经过了核反应堆堆芯的冷却水和没经过堆芯的冷却水是不同的两回事前者叫做一级冷却水后者叫做二级冷却水二级冷却水虽然没有经过堆芯但也会含有微量的放射性其最主要的放射性元素就是氚元素只要符合国际原子能机构的安全标准就可以直接排放入海,2023-08-28 08:15:31,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.351349302489088e+18,ZoeChen33469892,Zoe Cheng,https://twitter.com/ZoeChen33469892/status/1695953219657376012,post,https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1354658514979852289/OrSSE1zA_normal.jpg,,background,0.0,240_china_nuclear_pollution,

Japanese nuclear power experts believe that there should be better methods for treating nuclear wastewater. Hydrogen release from the formation and injection into underground burial steam release schemes have higher economic costs， but have no impact on other countries. The most economical and worst approach is to discharge Japanese nuclear wastewater into the sea,日本宣布核污染水排海日期 24日起日本将开始核污染水排海 日本核电专家认为处理核污水应该有更好的方法 氢气释放地层注入地下掩埋蒸汽释放方案经济成本较高但对其他国家没有影响最经济最不好的做法就是向大海排放 日本核污水,2023-08-22 11:12:08,11.0,82.0,12.0,1.4185609881529303e+18,JoanChe92404610,廣州小蠻腰,https://twitter.com/JoanChe92404610/status/1694660726764495221,post,https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1418561598440894472/7BILQd-m_normal.jpg,,background,0.0,240_china_nuclear_pollution,
twitter,1694611877563941106,What is wrong with Japan? It is a mistake to falsely claim that nuclear wastewater is treated as nuclear wastewater. Every nuclear power plant has nuclear wastewater， which is only used for cooling treatment and does not come into contact with radioactive substances. After treatment， it can be discharged domestically， even if it is the same for all nuclear power plants in the world. What is nuclear wastewater? It is the water produced by the melting and cooling water of the core in Fukushima， which was directly in contact with radioactive substances， after the tsunami. This is the nuclear wastewater released by Japan.

twitter,1695774627161952436,What am I saying for Japan? I saw on the oil pipe that the amount of core cooling water is still increasing and there is no space left. It's not that the core cooling water is directly discharged into the sea， but rather that radioactive elements other than tritium are filtered out and diluted with seawater. These are all from relevant news.

twitter,1695000734885089355,The cooling water of a nuclear reactor is nuclear wastewater， and the water contaminated after the leakage of nuclear materials is nuclear wastewater. These two concepts are the purification promised by the Japanese， which requires a large amount of cost. When it is actually discharged， who will supervise and deliberately confuse the public is more suspicious. What international atomic energy is all nonsense? The United States has also compromised to let Japan continue whaling for profit.

Fukushima's first cooling water system is involved in cooling the radiation heat released by the core nuclear fuel rods of the nuclear power plant. It directly experiences high tritium concentration and contains radioactive heavy elements. Qinshan's second cooling water system is used to cool the first cooling water to maintain the thermal balance of the entire nuclear power plant. This cooling water does not enter the nuclear radiation zone and does not intersect with the first cooling water.

twitter,1695953219657376012,Japan's discharge is not nuclear wastewater， but rather nuclear wastewater. The concept of cooling water that has passed through the core of a nuclear reactor and cooling water that has not passed through the core are different. The former is called primary cooling water， while the latter is called secondary cooling water. Although it has not passed through the core， secondary cooling water also contains trace amounts of radioactivity. The main radioactive element is tritium， which can be directly discharged into the sea as long as it meets the safety standards of the International Atomic Energy Agency,日本排放的不是核废水而是核污水概念经过了核反应堆堆芯的冷却水和没经过堆芯的冷却水是不同的两回事前者叫做一级冷却水后者叫做二级冷却水二级冷却水虽然没有经过堆芯但也会含有微量的放射性其最主要的放射性元素就是氚元素只要符合国际原子能机构的安全标准就可以直接排放入海,2023-08-28 08:15:31,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.351349302489088e+18,ZoeChen33469892,Zoe Cheng,https://twitter.com/ZoeChen33469892/status/1695953219657376012,post,https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1354658514979852289/OrSSE1zA_normal.jpg,,background,0.0,cooling_water_nuclear_wastewater,

twitter,1694611877563941106,What is wrong with Japan? It is a mistake to falsely claim that nuclear wastewater is treated as nuclear wastewater. Every nuclear power plant has nuclear wastewater， which is only used for cooling treatment and does not come into contact with radioactive substances. After treatment， it can be discharged domestically， even if it is the same for all nuclear power plants in the world. What is nuclear wastewater? It is the water produced by the melting and cooling water of the core in Fukushima， which was directly in contact with radioactive substances， after the tsunami. This is the nuclear wastewater released by Japan. Now we can understand it,日本错在哪是错在把核污水狡辩称作核废水来放每个核电站都有核废水核废水只用作冷却处理不会接触到放射性物质经过处理就能排国内哪怕世界所有核电站都这样核污水是什么是之前海啸给福岛干出堆芯融解冷却水直接接触放射性物质产生的水这才是日本放的核污水现在能看懂了,2023-08-24 15:25:30,0.0,8.0,9.0,1.66890580450492e+18,gaku39853081629,gaku,https://twitter.com/gaku39853081629/status/1694611877563941106,post,https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1668921797163761664/GtLkknqs_normal.jpg,,background,0.0,cooling_water_nuclear_wastewater,

twitter,1694612178769502228,What is wrong with Japan? It is a mistake to falsely claim that nuclear wastewater is treated as nuclear wastewater. Every nuclear power plant has nuclear wastewater， which is only used for cooling treatment and does not come into contact with radioactive substances. After treatment， it can be discharged domestically， even if it is the same for all nuclear power plants in the world. What is nuclear wastewater? It is the water produced by the melting and cooling water of the core in Fukushima， which was directly in contact with radioactive substances， after the tsunami. This is the nuclear wastewater released by Japan. Now we can understand it,日本错在哪是错在把核污水狡辩称作核废水来放每个核电站都有核废水核废水只用作冷却处理不会接触到放射性物质经过处理就能排国内哪怕世界所有核电站都这样核污水是什么是之前海啸给福岛干出堆芯融解冷却水直接接触放射性物质产生的水这才是日本放的核污水现在能看懂了,2023-08-24 15:26:42,1.0,29.0,1.0,1.66890580450492e+18,gaku39853081629,gaku,https://twitter.com/gaku39853081629/status/1694612178769502228,post,https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1668921797163761664/GtLkknqs_normal.jpg,,background,0.0,cooling_water_nuclear_wastewater,

twitter,1694676380930490874,First of all， please recognize the reality. 1. The Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan produces thousands of nuclear wastewater treatment buckets after an explosion and leakage. The water discharged into the sea by Japan is in contact with the water leaked from the Fukushima nuclear power plant， which is fundamentally different from general nuclear cooling water. 2. The treatment of nuclear contaminated water is not entirely limited to the tritium you mentioned. Among them， there are other substances that have the greatest impact on human marine life， such as carbon， 14， iodine， and 129. 3. The United Nations does not approve of discharging into the sea,首先请你认清现实 1日本福岛核电站是爆炸泄漏后才产生上千个核废水的处理桶日本排海的水是接触到福岛核电站泄漏的水和一般核冷却水有着本质上的区别 2核污染水的处理并不完全不只有你所说的氚其中还有其他对人类对海洋生物影响危害最大的是碳14碘129 3联合国并不赞同排海,2023-08-24 19:41:49,0.0,0.0,0.0,3185390746.0,Liz000117,林是山间林,https://twitter.com/Liz000117/status/1694676380930490874,post,https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1712495677681614848/J8-Ov8FK_normal.jpg,,background,0.0,cooling_water_nuclear_wastewater,

Either a specialized nuclear wastewater storage facility is established in large cities， where cans are stored all over the city. Japan has such a small land， and even if the land is scarce， it is difficult for the people to pay an extremely painful price.
