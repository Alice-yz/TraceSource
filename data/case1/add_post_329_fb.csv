facebook,946502866824129,"FROM THE WINY RADIO NEWSROOM: Judge dismisses some charges against Trump in the Georgia election interference case

ATLANTA (AP) ‚Äî The judge overseeing the Georgia election interference case on Wednesday dismissed some of the charges against former President Donald Trump, but many other counts in the indictment remain.

Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee wrote in an order that six of the counts in the indictment must be quashed, including three against Trump, the presumptive 2024 Republican presidential nominee.

But the order leaves intact other charges, and the judge wrote that prosecutors could seek a new indictment on the charges he dismissed.

The six charges in question have to do with soliciting elected officials to violate their oaths of office. That includes two charges related to the phone call Trump made to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a fellow Republican, on Jan. 2, 2021.

‚ÄúAll I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have,‚Äù Trump said.

The case accuses Trump and 18 others of conspiring to overturn his 2020 election loss in the state to Democrat Joe Biden. Trump has pleaded not guilty.

The ruling comes as McAfee is also considering a bid by defendants to have Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis removed from the case. Defendants have alleged that Willis has a conflict of interest because of her romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade.

In leaving the trial date intact, Judge Juan Manuel Merchan took advantage of a delay in a separate prosecution in Washington charging Trump with plotting to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.

That case has been effectively on hold pending the outcome of an appeal from Trump.

The hearing was held in the same Manhattan courtroom where he pleaded not guilty last April to 34 counts of falsifying business records in an alleged scheme to bury stories about extramarital affairs that arose during his 2016 presidential campaign.

Trump entered the courthouse shortly before 9am.

It was Mr Trump‚Äôs first return visit to court in the New York criminal case since that historic indictment made him the first ex-president charged with a crime.

Since then, he has also been indicted in Florida, Georgia and Washington DC.

In recent weeks, he has blended campaign events with court appearances, attending a closed hearing on Monday in a Florida case charging him with hoarding classified records.

Judge Merchan has taken steps in recent weeks to prepare for a trial. If it goes off as planned, it would be the first of Mr Trump‚Äôs criminal cases to go to trial.

facebook,789507636379665,"The Biden administration is reportedly considering using executive authority to impose harsh immigration measures, including a push to end asylum for migrants crossing between ports of entry at the US-Mexico border‚Äîa move that the Trump administration tried in 2018 and was shot down by the courts.

Former President Donald Trump infamously weaponized this authority against travelers from Muslim-majority countries.

Losing a child is a parent's worst nightmare! As you can imagine, it's painful. Erica and Avimael Qui√±ones know that pain firsthand. However, they are now using that tragedy to set an inspiring example.

In 2020, their 4-year-old daughter, Averi, faced a bone cancer diagnosis, prompting the couple to confront the disease head-on in a determined effort to save her. Initiating a GoFundMe account, they embarked on Averi‚Äôs chemotherapy journey, receiving support from thousands of compassionate people. While Erika continued her work at a pharmacy, Abimael grappled with unemployment brought on by the pandemic.

Despite their collective efforts and the unwavering support of family and the community, August 2020 brought the devastating news of Averi‚Äôs passing at the age of 5, leaving her parents and siblings in profound grief.

In tribute to Averi, Erika and Abimael established a non-profit called ""The Averi Foundation."" The foundation has already helped more than 12 children facing similar health challenges, thanks to the generosity of donors. With a commitment to expanding their reach, the Qui√±ones family organizes fundraising activities, ensuring the legacy of a little girl who embodied dedication and resilience continues to impact lives.

Their sole objective is to give back to the community, acknowledging that the parents and families of children battling illness often endure severe economic hardships.

Under the mentorship of Dr. Lennart Johnsson, a pioneering figure in HPC, my role evolved, resulting in a promotion to Associate Director of TLC2.

I participated in the negotiation and implementation of the Research and Education Network of Houston, a robust infrastructure connecting academic institutions that created the cornerstone to the State of Texas research network, the Lonestar Education And Research Network. 

I built collaborations merging humanities and technology, such as partnering with the Moore's Opera to create 3D sets‚Äîa feat preceding the Metropolitan Opera's endeavor by six months.

I have demonstrated my commitment to diversity and inclusion in tech, notably through speaking engagements at summer camps for girls and minority youth, and obtaining certification in Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion from Cornell.

The Mescalero Apaches were a semi-nomadic people who once roamed the area of New Mexico, West Texas, and Chihuahua. The word ""Apache"" means ""enemy"" in the Zu√±i language, as they were feared by the pueblo tribes of northern New Mexico as well by the Spanish. The Gila and Chiricahua Apaches were to the west and the Lipan Apaches to the east, but the Mescaleros were once the largest and most powerful Apache nation among them.
The Mescaleros are documented archeologically in our region as early as the thirteenth century. They began raiding local Spanish settlements and traveling caravans starting in the 1680s. Between 1778 and 1825 there was a large band of Mescaleros encamped on the future site of Duranguito and Downtown El Paso, peaking at about one thousand men, women and children in the 1790s.
The Spanish, Mexicans and Americans all waged wars of extermination against this proud and fierce people. Today the remaining Mescaleros possess a small reservation in southern New Mexico.

Pleasanton Express will be writing a feature on Irma and her new historical fiction book‚ÄùLos Tejanos De Bexar.‚Äù

The Pleasanton Express has signed paperback copies that we will be giving away! 

 ‚ÄúLos Tejanos Bexar‚Äù

1835 deep in the Mexican state of Texas. The once peaceful city of Bexar, with its fiestas and fandangos, has come under attack by Mexican General Santa Anna who is determined to bend the Bexarenos to his will. They are determined to do theirs. Already there has been house to house fighting with fatalities. How much more can the citizens of Bexar endure?

Many Bexarenos face a difficult choice: fight to free Texas from Santa Anna's tyrannical grip or remain loyal to their mother country, Mexico.

For Alejandro Casta√±on, who fled Ciudad de M√©xico with his daughter Cristina to leave what he saw as the political injustices of Santa Anna behind, the decision seems clear. 

However not everyone agrees with him, and some begin to question his loyalty, even to his family. To make matters more complicated, Norte Americanos arrive daily in preparation for war against Santa Anna inviting anyone who wants a better way of life to join them.

The Curandera saw blood and death for the Bexarenos. Was she right? Can Alejandro go against his family and friends? Will any stand with him? And what if they should lose?

In Los Tejanos de Bexar, author Irma Olivares retells the famous story of the battle of the Alamo from the often forgotten perspective of the ordinary Mexicans and Spaniards who fought on the Texas side. Known as Tejanos, the role of these men and women was often underplayed or completely left out of history books, until now.

facebook,726760532939577,"Today was filled with mixed emotions. We sent a few Rehabbers/Transporters from our team, to the wildfire stricken areas, to look for orphaned and injured wildlife. We covered almost 300 miles over the course of 9.5 hours. 

The pictures and videos you see online/television of the damage don‚Äôt do justice to seeing it in person. The devastation is insurmountable.  Many people lost their entire homes, vehicles, herds, and a few, even their lives. 

It is easy to be overcome with the reality of it all.  Especially when the fires are still burning. However, you have to focus on how ‚Äúyou‚Äù as an organization or person can help and do that! Collectively, when everyone works together, we as a community persevere. And that is what we saw. 

On the way to Fritch, Borger, Pampa, and Canadian we passed multiple trucks, semis, and vehicles pulling flatbeds with supplies (hay, feed, barbed wire‚Ä¶).  It reminds you that there is far more good in the world than bad. 

We did not see any wildlife in need on this day and only a few that didn‚Äôt make it. It was a pleasant surprise. We can‚Äôt forget, wild animals are smart, and can sense things even before us.  Even while walking the Gene Howe Wildlife Management √Årea we were reminded of that. While walking through smoldering ground we saw fresh footprints of animals like raccoons, opossums, coyotes, and much more by the water. They made it!!

We also made new connections in those areas with law enforcement, biologists, and game wardens who didn‚Äôt know there was a wildlife rehabilitation facility in the Texas Panhandle.  Those new relationships will help more wildlife for years to come. 

Lastly, we have had an influx of animals but mainly from the high winds, which continue tomorrow.  We have now taken in over 11 baby squirrels in the past few days and multiple birds. Thank you for your continued support via Amazon supplies, monetary donations, and sharing our posts. We love our wildlife in the Texas Panhandle and cannot do it without you.","Today was filled with mixed emotions.

Apache bands include the Chiricahua, Jicarilla, Lipan, Mescalero, Mimbre√±o, Salinero, Plains, and Western Apache (Aravaipa, Pinale√±o, Coyotero, and Tonto). Today, Apache tribes and reservations are headquartered in Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and Oklahoma. Each tribe is politically autonomous.

The Apache tribes fought the invading Spanish and Mexican peoples for centuries. The first Apache raids on Sonora appear to have taken place during the late 17th century.

States receive funds that are distributed in their budget process (like funds to help foster kids as they transition into adulthood that our governor turned down -just sayin). 

Here's a recent list of funds allocated in the 4th congrssional district. From a press release from Rep. Johnson's office.

$500,000 for DeKalb County Community Schoolyards

$145,335 for Increasing Pedestrian and Vehicular Safety via the Realignment of Chestnut at Buford Highway in the City of Doraville.

$850,000 for DeKalb County for Kittredge Athletic Fields

$800,000 for North Fork Peachtree Creek Trail (Phase 1) in DeKalb County.

$1,000,000 for PDK Airport Design and Demolition Administration Building

$959,752 for Rockdale County for Almand Branch Wastewater Treatment Project

$959,752 for Rockdale County for Honey and Scott Creek Pump Stations and Force Mains Project
