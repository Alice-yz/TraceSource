weibo,4938858000810318,"Why hasn't most countries in the world opposed Japan's discharge of nuclear contaminated water, except for China and South Korea? The truth is actually very simple, because most countries are far away from Japan, while China and South Korea face Japan across the sea, relative to the two most affected countries. The United States and Canada are two oceanic countries, bordered by the Pacific Ocean to the west and the Atlantic Ocean to the east, while Europe is also an Atlantic country. The Pacific Ocean has been contaminated by nuclear weapons, and there is also an Atlantic Ocean to the east of the United States and Canada. Therefore, the fish and seafood products of the United States and Europe will not be greatly affected, and only a few Pacific countries in Asia are at great risk. Even so, the United States wouldn't be so supportive of Japan's maritime discharge, would it? There is also a huge business opportunity among them. In the future, what should China and Asian countries do if they want to eat seafood? They can only import seafood from the Pacific (including seafood from China and Japan). At that time, the United States and Europe will export seafood at high prices and can only import from them. Although we can understand your doubts about the United States and European countries, we cannot conclude whether they are secretly pleased or have commercial interests. This involves complex geopolitical, economic, and environmental factors. For us, the discharge of Japanese nuclear wastewater into the sea is harmful and not beneficial, and we are a responsible major country. Therefore, we must strongly oppose it in any aspect. Boycotting Japanese goods starts with me!",为什么除了中国和韩国民众世界上大多数国家都没有反对日本排放核污染水？  其实道理很简单，因为大多数国家都离日本很遥远，而中国和韩国与日本隔海相望，相对的是受影响最大的两个国家。美国、加拿大是两洋国家，西边太平洋，东边大西洋，而欧洲也都是大西洋国家，太平洋受了核污染，美国和加拿大东边还有个大西洋，所以美国和欧洲鱼类海产品也不会受太大影响，只有亚洲的几个太平洋国家危害惨重。  那即便是这样，美国也不至于这么支持日本排海吧？这其中还有巨大商机，以后中国和亚洲国家要吃海鲜怎么办，只能进口，太平洋里的海产品是都不能吃了（包括中国和日本的海产品都不能吃了），到时美国和欧洲会以高价出口海产品，而且只能从他们那里进口。  虽然我们可以理解你对于美国和欧洲国家的疑问，但对于他们是否暗自窃喜或是否有商业利益的推测，我们不能够断定。这涉及到复杂的地缘政治、经济和环境  对我们来说日本核废水icon排入海里是百害而无一利的，而且我们是负责任的大国，所以不管从那方面来说，我们都是要强烈反对的。          抵制日货从我做起！,2023-08-26 05:29:29,1.0,113.0,0.0,2717562610,小萌爸看盘,小萌爸看盘,https://weibo.com/2717562610/NgiSc3oNE,post,"https://tvax4.sinaimg.cn/crop.0.0.713.713.1024/a1fab6f2ly8hd480jwydcj20jt0jtmyd.jpg?KID=imgbed,tva&Expires=1710950286&ssig=8skREiE96f",https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/orj960/a1fab6f2gy1hh9p3xwkvfj20zi0hodle,highlight,-0.4,south_korea_nuclear_discharge,

There are also many voices deliberately confusing the difference between the nuclear wastewater discharged from China's coastal nuclear power plants and the Fukushima nuclear power plant, slandering China for also polluting the ocean. After China boycotted Japanese seafood, the first thing that came to mind was that it could eat cheap seafood in the future and clamored to boycott Chinese tourists and all Chinese products equally. Occasionally, someone who comes out and says that nuclear wastewater is not nuclear wastewater will be attacked by a group. It can only be said that the selfishness and brainlessness exhibited by the entire online public opinion are very worthy of the irresponsible actions of the Kishida government. Today is another day when my dislike for Japan is gradually increasing.",去推特转了一圈，看到日本人几乎是全员支持核污水排海的。 还有很多声音故意混淆中国沿海核电站排放的核废水与福岛核电站核污水的区别，污蔑中国也在污染海洋，并且中国全线抵制日本海产之后第一个想到的是今后自己可以吃到便宜的海产品了和嚷嚷着要对等抵制中国游客以及所有中国产品。 偶尔有个把个出来说核污水不是核废水的会被群起攻击。 只能说整个网络舆论表现出来的自私和无脑非常配得上岸田政府的不负责任。 今天又是对日本的讨厌情绪逐渐增加的一天。,2023-08-25 06:51:19,1.0,5.0,0.0,7623875840,小咪是世上最英俊的橘猫,小咪是世上最英俊的橘猫,https://weibo.com/7623875840/Ng9YUmGeC,post,"https://tvax1.sinaimg.cn/crop.0.0.1080.1080.1024/008jX0nmly8gzt3k44bo9j30u00u0whk.jpg?KID=imgbed,tva&Expires=1710929817&ssig=oyvTLfH%2BqZ",,w19,-0.66,cooling_water_nuclear_wastewater,

weibo,4940070635180805,"[# Japanese university lecturers used slander against China to clean up the sea #, New Zealand media hit back] According to the global network, on August 24, Japan's Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant launched the release of nuclear contaminated water into the sea, which caused dissatisfaction from many people, including the Japanese people, but some people were also defending the Japanese government... On August 26 (Beijing time, the same below), Jeffrey Hall, a scholar who was certified as ""a distinguished lecturer of a Japanese university"" and claimed on his personal website to be ""specializing in Japanese political and social issues"", wrote on social platform X (original Twitter) that ""the Chinese government, out of political motivation, implemented the policy of The ban seems to have led some consumers to panic buying salt (although nuclear power plants in Chinese Mainland have been discharging similar wastewater for many years). This tweet sparked some debates among netizens after its release, with some agreeing and others questioning his statement and demanding evidence. On August 28th, New Zealand media person An Boran noticed the above post and replied, ""No, it's not right."". While denying Hall's statement, Amber Ran also attached a picture that provides a simple and clear comparison between the normal cooling water of the nuclear power plant and the contaminated water of the Fukushima nuclear power plant, indicating that the two are different. The contaminated water of the Fukushima nuclear power plant is contaminated with nuclear fuel in the nuclear reactor. Previously, Japanese media claimed that records from Chinese nuclear power plants showed that the level of tritium in wastewater also exceeded the highest level of tritium in the nuclear contaminated water that Japan will discharge. On August 23, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin retaliated, emphasizing Japan's intention to confuse Fukushima nuclear contaminated water with normal nuclear power plant wastewater, which precisely indicates that Japan is not scientific on this issue and intends to deceive the international community. Wang Wenbin stated at the time that the contaminated water from the Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan is water that passes through the melted core of the nuclear power plant. This type of contaminated water is completely different from the discharge of normal nuclear power plant wastewater, and their properties, sources, and treatment difficulties are different. ""China and other stakeholders have repeatedly pointed out that if nuclear contaminated water is safe, there is no need to discharge it into the sea; if it is not safe, it should not be discharged into the sea,"" said Wang Wenbin. It is worth noting that on the 28th, Hall replied to An Boran's post, sarcastically stating, ""Sorry, the level of radioactive pollution in China's nuclear power plant wastewater is actually higher,"" and stating that he cited ""reliable international sources of information."". On the same day, An Bairan once again responded to his statement, listing the basis for people's concerns about the safety of Fukushima nuclear contaminated water. ""Important difference: Fukushima is a nuclear disaster that has suffered three nuclear (core) meltdowns. The water they discharge has already been contaminated and radioactive upon contact with the core. There are no other nuclear power plants in the world that do this,"" said Aberan, citing another reason why Japan's nuclear contaminated water is widely questioned. ""Nuclear power plants around the world release tritium during normal operation, and the tritium emissions from French nuclear power plants are 10 times higher than those from Chinese nuclear power plants. However, the argument of tritium is deliberately misleading. Japan's Greenpeace Organization has listed other (radioactive) isotopes in Fukushima's contaminated water, including but not limited to strontium-90, which causes bone cancer."" ""Their harm is much greater."" Regarding An Boran's response, a netizen @ Hall below asked, ""Do you have any response to this?"" As of the time of publication, we have not seen Hall's response to the netizen. In addition, under the opening post of the article, some netizens questioned Hall's use of slander against China to whitewash Japan's nuclear contaminated water, saying, ""If you think Japan's water is safe, why don't you keep it in your backyard, or (discharge) it into your swimming pool, or preferably give it to your family to drink?"" Some netizens also believed that Hall seemed to have become a ""propaganda puppet"" of the Japanese government: ""Jeffrey has become a"" puppet ""of the Japanese government because he only cares about tritium. This is the purpose of the Japanese government. The real problem is what else is in the polluted water, and why Japan needs more than 30 years to discharge polluted water."" ""Nuclear wastewater is not nuclear contaminated water."" On August 28th, the Chinese Embassy in Japan announced that our Ambassador to Japan, Wu Jianghao, met with Japanese Deputy Foreign Affairs Officer Masaki Okano at an invitation to further clarify Japan's solemn position on the issue of Fukushima nuclear contaminated water being discharged into the sea, and demanded that Japan carefully answer the following three questions: Firstly, why does Japan deliberately emphasize that tritium has been diluted, but always evades other radioactive isotopes? Secondly, why does Japan not conduct comprehensive and systematic monitoring of the marine environment? Thirdly, why does Japan refuse other stakeholders to participate in the establishment of an international monitoring mechanism# Japan is using despicable means to turn a blind eye to China#",【#日本大学讲师借污蔑中国为排海洗白#，新西兰媒体人回击】据环球网，8月24日，日本福岛第一核电站启动核污染水排海，引发包括日本民众在内的多国人士不满，然而也有人在为日政府开脱……  8月26日（北京时间，下同），认证为“日本某大学特聘讲师”、在个人网站自称“专门研究日本政治和社会问题”的学者杰弗里·霍尔在社交平台X（原推特）发文声称，“中国政府出于政治动机，在福岛（核）废水（排放）之际，实施了对日本水产品的禁令，这似乎导致一些消费者恐慌性购买食盐（尽管中国大陆的核电站多年来一直在排放类似的废水）。”文字下方，他还配上一段来源不明的“抢购视频”。  这一推文在发出后引发一些网友争论，有人表示赞同，也有不少人质疑他的说法，并要求其拿出证据。  8月28日，新西兰媒体人安柏然注意到上述帖文并回复：“不对”。否定霍尔的说法的同时，安柏然也附上了一张图片，图片对正常的核电站冷却水与福岛核污染水进行了简单明确的对比说明，即这两者是不同的，福岛核污染水受到了核反应堆中核燃料的污染。  此前，有日媒曾宣称，中国核电站的记录显示，废水中的氚水平也超过了日本将排放的核污染水中氚的最高含量。对此，中国外交部发言人汪文斌8月23日予以回击，强调日方有意把福岛核污染水同正常的核电站废水混为一谈，恰恰表明了日方在这个问题上不科学，有意蒙蔽国际社会。  汪文斌当时表示，日本福岛核污染水是经过核电站熔化堆芯的水，这种污染水同正常的核电站废水的排放完全不是一码事，两者的性质不同、来源不同、处理难度不同。“中方等利益攸关方也多次指出，如果核污染水是安全的，就没有必要排海；如果不安全就更不应该排海，”汪文斌说道。  值得注意的是，28日，霍尔回复安柏然的帖文，阴阳怪气地称“抱歉，中国核电站废水中的放射性污染水平实际上更高”，并称自己引用了“国际上的可靠消息来源”。同日，安柏然对其说法再次进行回复，列出了人们对福岛核污染水安全性担忧的依据。  “重要区别：福岛是一场核灾难，遭受了3次核（堆芯）熔毁。他们排放的水在接触到堆芯后已经被污染和并具有放射性。世界上没有其他核电站这样做，”安柏然表示，并提出日本核污染水受到普遍质疑的另一个原因，“世界各地的核电站在正常运行过程中都会释放氚，法国核电站的氚排放量是中国核电站的10倍。但氚这个论点是故意迷惑你们的。日本绿色和平组织列出了福岛核污染水中的其他（放射性）同位素，包括但不限于导致骨癌的锶-90，它们的危害要大得多。”  对于安柏然这一回复，有网友在下方@霍尔，“对此有什么回应吗？”截至发稿前，尚未看到霍尔回复该网友。  此外，在文章开篇霍尔借污蔑中国为日本核污染水洗白的帖文下，也有网友表示质疑，“如果你觉得日本的水是安全的，为什么你不把它存在后院，或者（排进）你的泳池里（然后）游泳，或者最好是分给你的家人喝。”  还有网友认为，霍尔似乎已沦为日本政府“宣传傀儡”：“杰弗里已经成为日本政府的‘傀儡’，因为他只关注氚。这就是日本政府的目的。真正的问题是被污染的水里还有什么，以及为什么日本需要30多年的时间排放污染水。核废水不是核污染水。”  就在8月28日，中国驻日本大使馆发布消息称，我驻日本大使吴江浩应约会见日本外务事务次官冈野正敬，就福岛核污染水排海问题进一步向日方阐明严正立场，并要求日方认真回答以下三个问题：首先，为什么日方刻意强调氚元素经过了稀释处理，但始终对其它放射性核素闪烁其辞？第二，为什么日方不进行全面系统的海洋环境监测？第三，为什么日方拒绝其他利益攸关方共同参与建立国际监测机制？#日本正采取卑劣手段对中国倒打一耙#,2023-08-29 13:48:04,17.0,151.0,30.0,2028810631,新浪新闻,新浪新闻,https://weibo.com/2028810631/NgOq3lJLn,post,"https://tvax4.sinaimg.cn/crop.0.0.799.799.1024/002diGk7ly8h8vg36oqidj60m70m7mxs02.jpg?KID=imgbed,tva&Expires=1710931909&ssig=qXMGdbGW76",https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/orj960/002diGk7ly8hhdk7yrdjkj60ed0hngmx02,highlight,0.0,cooling_water_nuclear_wastewater,
